# Meeting Mode

This site’s Meeting Mode lives in two places:

- Quick Lookup hub → /lookup/ (one‑pagers)
- Classic Meeting Mode page → /meeting-mode

Use either entry. In live conversations:
- Press / to focus search, type “rag”, “sse”, “contracts”, or “prompts”.
- Open the one‑pager, speak from the talking points, show the diagram.
- Jump to the cheatsheet/runbook for copy/paste examples.
