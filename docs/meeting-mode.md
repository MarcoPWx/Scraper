# Meeting Mode

Meeting Mode is the “fast lookup” slice of your docs, optimized for live conversations when you need authoritative, copy‑ready material immediately.

## TL;DR
- Curated one‑pagers and cheatsheets designed for speed, not depth
- Each page: a crisp diagram, 7–10 talking points, a few tradeoffs, and copy/paste snippets
- Search‑first: press `/`, type a keyword (rag, sse, contracts, prompts), hit enter

## Why it exists
- In meetings you don’t have time to dig—just a clean diagram, a short talk track, and a concrete example.

## What it includes
- Architecture Gallery: context, pipeline, S2S envelopes, SSE resume
- One‑pagers: Architecture, RAG, Contracts, SSE/Resilience, plus Common Q&A
- Cheatsheets: prompts, rag pipeline knobs, contracts headers/retries, observability metrics, guardrails, gateway SSE
- Links to deeper material: each page ends with “See also” pointing to Lessons, Concepts, Labs, and Runbooks

## How to use it in the moment
- Press `/`, type “rag” (or “sse”, “contracts”), open the one‑pager
- Speak from the talking points; show the diagram
- For “how”: scroll to the cheatsheet/runbook link and copy an example
- If the conversation goes deep, jump to the linked Lesson

## Where it lives
- Home page: Meeting Mode quick links (Architecture Gallery, Cheatsheets, Common Q&A)
- Quick Lookup hub: /lookup/ (index of one‑pagers)
- Cheatsheets section: /cheatsheets/ (copy‑ready)
- Architecture Gallery: /architecture/GALLERY (all diagrams at a glance)

## Confidence and currency
- Every page shows Last Updated (from Git)
- Daily Notes under /learning/logs/YYYY‑MM‑DD.md for timestamped additions
- Extend by adding more one‑pagers as your architecture evolves

In short: Meeting Mode is the top layer of your docs oriented around “show, say, and do” in under a minute—diagram, talk track, and a snippet—plus one click to deeper material when needed.
